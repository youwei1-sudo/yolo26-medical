# YOLO26 Medical Dataset Configuration (2-class binary)
#
# Clinical context:
# - Binary classification: Suspicious vs Negative
# - Primary goal: "Don't miss any suspicious region"
# - DCIS + IDC merged into single "Suspicious" class
#
# Data format:
# - Uses Ultralytics-compatible format with image path lists
# - Labels generated from JSON manifests and symlinked to expected locations
#
# Dataset statistics:
#   Train: 19000 images
#   Val:   2275 images
#   Test:  17785 images
#   Total: 39060 images
#
# To regenerate labels, run:
#   python scripts/convert_manifest_to_ultralytics.py
